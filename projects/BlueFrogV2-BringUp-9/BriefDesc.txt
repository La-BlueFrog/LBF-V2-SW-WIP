TIMERS AND PWM
===============

Part 1: Timer with IT generation 

Set-up a timer at a given period - generate IP when period elapses.
In IT handler, toggle LED
==> this will cause LED to blink at rate defined by timer period
Stop timer after a while.

Repeat with a second timer at a different rate


Part 2: PWM generation.

Set up timer and selected channel to generate PWM,
output it on extension connector position 10 
  ==> cabbe observed with a scope
Also capture state of corresponding GPIO and set LED on or off depending on captured state.
This will cause LED to illustrate PWM status (blinks with same period and duty cycle)
