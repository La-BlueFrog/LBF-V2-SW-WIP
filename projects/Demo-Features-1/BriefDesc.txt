Demonstration of some features of the module
===========================================

1) Splash Screen
   Decode image SPLASH.SPE (.SPE for image with a Special role...) which is actually a BMP file
   + Welcome message

 Upon detection of object in front of proximity Detector, switch to:

2) "Free up" the frog : 
   Shift frog position according to accelerometer data
   The shift is done by changing the correspondance between memory addresses and
   position on the screen in the OLED

 Upon detection of skake (inversion of Z acceleration vector):

3) Turn frog schematic into actual frog :-)
   In fact simply display bitmap picture FROG.SPE (which has to be on the file system)

Upon inclination of screen:

4) Cycle through .BMP pictures stored on Flash File System, forward or backward depending
   on sign of Y acceleration vector

Upon pressing one of the side-push buttons (ignored while an image is being decoded):

5) Display an evaluation of the distance to any object placed in front of the proximity detector

Upon turning module upside down for a while (detected by Z accel vector):
Back to step 1
