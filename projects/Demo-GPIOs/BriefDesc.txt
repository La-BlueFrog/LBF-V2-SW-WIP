Demo GPIOs
==========

Through settings in User_Configuration.h :
- set position 2 as GPIO input with weak pull-down
- set position 5 as open-drain GPIO output

- set position 10 as Timer4 Ch4 output (i view of PWM generation)


Then using La BlueFrog API:

1) 1st part of demo

- toggle GPIO output on position 5 every 250ms
- constantly monitor value of GPIO inputs position 2;
  turn LED on or off according to value read

==>
Result: when connector pins left floating: LED keeps OFF
If connection made between position 2 and position 5:
Then LED blinks at same rate as GPIO toggles


If side-push switch #1 or #2 pressed --> change mode

2) 2nd part of demo

PWM on Timer 4 Channel 4 (available on position 10 of connector)
set for 200ms period, 50ms high pulse

Monitor status of position 10 of connector --> replicate pin status on LED
==> LED reflects behavior of PWM
(works ok as long as PWM is set to fairly long periods)
