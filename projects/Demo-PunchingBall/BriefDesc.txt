PUNCHING BALL DEMO
==================

Objective is to "measure" hit received by punching ball
by integrating acceleration of punching ball
from hit (1st non-negligible value) to start of deceleration (<0 value).
Then report result graphically and compare to previous records.

----

Demo enabled by <TBD>
Accelerometer is enabled at max sampling rate
Measure initial acceleration vector (gravity)
FIFO set to store <20? TBD> samples

FIFO set in continuous-to-FIFO mode with trigger = significant motion
So, once full, FIFO will contain the 20 acceleration values seens after punching ball has started to move. 
===> integrate the acceleration values as long as they're positive
